				<h2>1922 - 2018</h2>
				<h4>American comic book writer Stan Lee was the human behind the superheroes.</h4>
				<p>Many marvel at the man who gave his characters extraordinary powers and everyday headaches - a formula which revolutionised comics.<br/>
				The Hulk, Iron Man, Daredevil and the Fantastic Four all sprang from his fertile imagination and spilled onto the page.<br/>
				But while his career may have started in pen and ink, it grew and evolved into much more.<br/>
				From digital graphic novels to blockbuster Hollywood films; leading Marvel Comics from a small division of a publishing house to a large multimedia corporation; Stan Lee was prolific.<br/>
